Journalism JS
=============

(Or: News Hacking in NodeJS and the Browser)
--------------------------------------------

Although it has taken off with the wider development community, JavaScript is not yet a first choice for programming in many newsrooms, which often prefer Ruby or Python. This is a shame: in addition to being the only language that can be used in the browser, it also has a fast, well-supported server runtime in NodeJS, which uses Google's powerful V8 architecture.

In this set of tutorials, we'll cover how to use modern JavaScript libraries and tools to commit acts of data journalism. We'll process data, scrape web pages, and build interactives using deadline-friendly techniques.

What You'll Need
----------------

These tutorials assume some basic familiarity with JavaScript--you should know about functions, simple data structures, and script tags in an HTML page. You should also have Node installed. We'll be using NPM to install dependencies for the Node lessons, and [Bower](http://bower.io) for client-side lessons. In general, if there's a `package.json` file, you should run `npm install` for each tutorial directory, and if there's a `bower.json`, you can use `bower install` to fetch its browser libraries.
